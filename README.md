## 🔍 Key Features

### 🧠 Modular AI Agents
- Each agent handles a **specific customer success function** (e.g., onboarding queries vs upsell predictions).
- Supports **multi-turn dialogues** with memory (LangMem).
- Each agent can invoke **tools** like vector search, analytics lookups, or API calls.

### 🧭 Meta-Agent with LangGraph
- Orchestrates across all agents.
- Makes routing decisions based on query intent, confidence, and historical context.
- Enables **multi-agent workflows**, e.g. onboarding → product usage → upsell.

### 📡 Real-time Context Injection (MCP)
- Built a custom tool to **fetch and merge data** from CRM, product analytics, and customer DBs.
- Dynamically injects the latest usage stats, plan info, and engagement signals into the prompt.

### 📈 Logs & Cost Tracking
- Every request logs:
  - `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens`
  - `run_time_ms`, `cost_usd`, `cost_inr`
  - agent name, tool calls
- Enables **transparency + optimization** of LLM usage.

### 🛠️ Tool Integration
- Agents can call:
  - `semantic_search_tool` (FAISS vector DB)
  - `report_generator_tool` (Python/SQL)
  - `churn_predictor_tool` (ML model)
  - `product_usage_fetcher` (via MCP)
